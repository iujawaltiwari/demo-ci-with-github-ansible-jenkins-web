            <p>This is a basic HTML file for a Continuous Integration example.</p>
            <p>Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically building and testing code changes frequently, typically multiple times per day. It involves integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository continuously.</p>
            <p>CI helps to detect and fix integration errors quickly, ensuring that the software remains in a working state. It also promotes collaboration among team members and speeds up the delivery of new features and bug fixes.</p>
